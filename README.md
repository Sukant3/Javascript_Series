Drag & Drop 

In this we will create a drag and drop navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This interactive menu allows users to reorder navigation items by simply dragging and dropping them. 

The design features aesthetic gradients, smooth animations, and a glassmorphism effect, making it visually appealing. With just a few lines of JavaScript, we will enable seamless drag-and-drop functionality without relying on external libraries. 

Letâ€™s dive in and build this stylish and user-friendly navigation menu.
